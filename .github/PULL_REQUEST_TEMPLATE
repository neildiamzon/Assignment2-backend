- **PEP 8 Compliance**:
  - [ ] Is there consistent **indentation** (preferably 4 spaces per indentation level)?

- **Whitespace and Line Spacing**:
  - [ ] Are **blank lines** used effectively to separate functions, classes, and method definitions?

- **Naming Conventions for Variables and Functions**:
  - [ ] Are **variable** and **function names** clear and meaningful, adhering to the **snake_case** naming convention?

- **Code Modularization**:
  - [ ] Is the code **structured** into smaller methods or classes, each responsible for a specific functionality?

- **Code Documentation**:
  - [ ] Is the code **self-explanatory** where possible (e.g., through clear variable names, simple logic, etc.)?
